Using security parameter 40
Significant amount of unused bits of Shamir gfp. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
Note that some protocols have larger minimum batch sizes.
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 0.372885 seconds 
Data sent = 0.32648 MB in ~54 rounds (party 1; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 1.14536 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of 'voting_sum_with_verify.mpc':
	program.use_edabit(True)
