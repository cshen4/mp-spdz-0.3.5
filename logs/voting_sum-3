Using security parameter 40
Significant amount of unused bits of Shamir gfp. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
Note that some protocols have larger minimum batch sizes.
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 16.563 seconds 
Data sent = 0 MB in ~36 rounds (party 3; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 1.96285 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of 'voting_sum.mpc':
	program.use_edabit(True)
